        <p>
          Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a progressive framework for
          building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is
          designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core
          library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and
          integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other
          hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated
          Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling
          and supporting libraries.

        <p>
          If you’d like to learn more about Vue before diving in, we created a
          video walking through the core principles and a sample project.

          compares to other libraries/frameworks, check out the Comparison with
          Other Frameworks.

          The official guide assumes intermediate level knowledge of HTML, CSS,
          and JavaScript. If you are totally new to frontend development, it
          might not be the best idea to jump right into a framework as your
          first step - grasp the basics then come back! Prior experience with
          other frameworks helps, but is not required.

          The easiest way to try out Vue.js is using the Hello World example.
          Feel free to open it in another tab and follow along as we go through
          some basic examples. Or, you can create an index.html file and include
          Vue with:
        </p>

        <pre> <code> <span class="comments">&lt;!-- development version, includes helpful console warnings --&gt;</span>
 <span class="scripts">&lt;script src=</span><span class="scripts-values">"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js"</span><span class="scripts">&gt; &lt;/script&gt;</span></code>
</pre>

        <div>
          or
        </div>

        <pre> <code> <span class="comments">&lt;!-- production version, optimized for size and speed --&gt;</span>
 <span class="scripts">&lt;script src=</span><span class="scripts-values">"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue"</span><span class="scripts">&gt; &lt;/script&gt;</span></code>
</pre>

        <p>
          The Installation page provides more options of installing Vue. Note:
          We do not recommend that beginners start with vue-cli, especially if
          you are not yet familiar with Node.js-based build tools.
        </p>

          If you prefer something more interactive, you can also check out this
          tutorial series on Scrimba, which gives you a mix of screencast and
          code playground that you can pause and play around with anytime.

          <h4>Declarative Rendering</h4>
        </header>
        <p>
          At the core of Vue.js is a system that enables us to declaratively
          render data to the DOM using straightforward template syntax:
        </p>
        <pre> <code> <span class="scripts">&lt;div id=</span><span class="scripts-values">"app"</span><span class="scripts">&gt; </span>
  {{ message }}
 <span class="scripts">&lt;/div&gt; </span></code></pre>
        <div></div>
        <pre> <code><span class="keywords">var</span> app = <span class="keywords">new</span> Vue({
  el: <span class="scripts-values">'#app'</span>,
  data: {
    message:  <span class="scripts-values">'Hello Vue!'</span>
  }
})     </code></pre>

        <div class="output">
          Hello Vue
        </div>

        <p>
          We have already created our very first Vue app! This looks pretty
          similar to rendering a string template, but Vue has done a lot of work
          under the hood. The data and the DOM are now linked, and everything is
          now reactive. How do we know? Open your browser’s JavaScript console
          (right now, on this page) and set app.message to a different value.
          You should see the rendered example above update accordingly.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note that we no longer have to interact with the HTML directly. A Vue
          app attaches itself to a single DOM element (#app in our case) then
          fully controls it. The HTML is our entry point, but everything else
          happens within the newly created Vue instance.

          <h4>Composing with Components</h4>
        </header>
        <p>
          The component system is another important concept in Vue, because it’s
          an abstraction that allows us to build large-scale applications
          composed of small, self-contained, and often reusable components. If
          we think about it, almost any type of application interface can be
          abstracted into a tree of components:
        </p>

        <p>
          <img src="./assets/components.png" alt="Component Tree" />
        </p>

        <p>
          In Vue, a component is essentially a Vue instance with pre-defined
          options. Registering a component in Vue is straightforward:
        </p>
        <p>
          Now you can compose it in another component’s template:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>  <span class="scripts">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
   <span class="comments">&lt;!-- Create an instance of the todo-item component --&gt;</span>
   <span class="scripts">  &lt;todo-item&gt;&lt;/todo-item&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;</span></code></pre>
